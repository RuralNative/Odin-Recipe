        <li>Add the pork pieces to the marinade, making sure that each piece is well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the pork pieces (reserve the marinade) and fry until lightly browned on both sides. Remove the pork from the pan and set aside.</li>
