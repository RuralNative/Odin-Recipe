    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, bay leaves, and whole peppercorns. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, making sure that each piece is well coated. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken pieces (reserve the marinade) and fry until lightly browned on both sides. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pan, pour in the marinade and water. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and add the chicken back into the pan. Cover and let the chicken simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked and the sauce has thickened.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a serving dish and pour the sauce over the top. Garnish with chopped green onions or cilantro, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with steamed rice and enjoy your delicious Pinoy-style adobong manok!</li>
